# Loan_Predication

LOANS are the major requirement of the modern world. By this only, Banks get a major part of the total profit. It is beneficial for students to manage their education and living expenses, and for people to buy any kind of luxury like houses, cars, etc. But when it comes to deciding whether the applicant’s profile is relevant to be granted with loan or not. Banks have to look after many aspects.	We are going to develop one such model that can predict whether a person will get his/her loan approved or not by using some of the background information of the applicant like the applicant’s gender, marital status, income, etc
